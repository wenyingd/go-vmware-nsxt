However, in some cases this can be different because of entities have migrated thier unique identifier to NSX Policy intent objects later in the timeline and did not use unique_id for realization. Realization id is helpful for users to debug data path to correlate the configuration with corresponding intent.

	// Max Response Time inserted into Group-Specific Queries sent in response to Leave Group messages, and is also the amount of time between Group-Specific Query messages. This value may be tuned to modify the \"leave latency\" of the network. A reduced value results in reduced time to detect the loss of the last member of a group.

Configuring this interval allows admins to adjust the burstiness of IGMP messages on the subnet; larger values make the traffic less bursty, as host responses are spread out over a larger interval.  The number of seconds represented by the query_max_response_time must be less than the query_interval. 
	QueryMaxResponseTime int32 `json:"query_max_response_time,omitempty"`
	// The Robustness Variable allows tuning for the expected packet loss on a subnet. If a subnet is expected to be lossy, the Robustness Variable may be increased. IGMP is robust to (Robustness Variable-1) packet losses. The Robustness Variable must not be zero, and SHOULD NOT be one.
