	// Request identifier to keep track of calculated aggregated configuration a draft during subsequent API calls after initial API call. This identifier can be use to fetch the detailed aggregated configuration at security policy level. Absence of request_id suggests that whole aggregated configuration has been returned as a response to initial API call, as the size of aggregated configuration is not big enough to need pagination.
