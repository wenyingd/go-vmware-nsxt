	// DPD probe interval defines an interval for DPD probes (in seconds). - When the DPD probe mode is periodic, this interval is the number of seconds between DPD messages. - When the DPD probe mode is on-demand, this interval is the number of seconds during which traffic is not received from the peer before DPD retry messages are sent if there is IPSec traffic to send.

	// DPD probe mode is used to query the liveliness of the peer. Two modes are possible: - PERIODIC: is used to query the liveliness of the peer at regular intervals (dpd_probe_interval). It does not take into consideration traffic coming from the peer. The benefit of this mode over the on-demand mode is earlier detection of dead peers. However, use of periodic DPD incurs extra overhead. When communicating to large numbers of peers, please consider using on-demand DPD instead. - ON_DEMAND: is used to query the liveliness of the peer by instructing the local endpoint to send DPD message to a peer if there is traffic to send to the peer AND the peer was idle for dpd_probe_interval seconds (i.e. there was no traffic from the peer for dpd_probe_interval seconds).
