// Detail about one error encountered during a probe.
type LdapProbeError struct {
	// The cause of the error.  BASE_DN_NOT_FOUND: The configured base DN does not exist on the     LDAP server or is not readable. BIND_DN_AND_PASSWORD_REQUIRED: This server is configured to     require a bind DN and password. Please add these to your     LDAP server configuration. BIND_DN_INVALID: The bind DN or username provided is not valid     on the LDAP server. Check that the bind DN is correct.     This error may also indicate that the base DN in your     configuration is incorrect. CERTIFICATE_HOSTNAME_MISMATCH_ERROR: The hostname configured for     the LDAP server does not match the hostname in the server's     certificate subject or alternative subject names. Be sure     that the hostname you configure in NSX Manager matches one     of those names. CERTIFICATE_MISMATCH_ERROR: The certificate presented by the     LDAP server did not match the certificate in the configuration     on the NSX Manager. CONNECTION_REFUSED: The connection was refused when contacting the     LDAP server. Ensure that the LDAP server is running and that     you are using the correct ip/hostname. CONNECTION_TIMEOUT: The connection timed out when contacting     the LDAP server. Check the hostname/ip and any firewalls     between the NSX Manager and the LDAP server. GENERAL_ERROR: An undetermined error occurred. INVALID_CONFIGURED_CERTIFICATE: The certificate configured for     this LDAP server is invalid and could not be decoded. Check     that the PEM-formatted certificate you provided is correct. INVALID_CREDENTIALS: The username and/or password are incorrect. SSL_HANDSHAKE_ERROR: An error occurred while establishing a secure     connection with the LDAP server. Check that the LDAP server's     certificate is correct, and that it is using an SSL/TLS     cipher suite that is compatible with the NSX Manager.     This error can also occur if the hostname you have configured     for the LDAP server does not match any of the hostnames in     the Subject Alternative Name records in the server     certificate. STARTTLS_FAILED: Unable to use StartTLS to upgrade the connection     to use TLS. Ensure that the LDAP server supports TLS and if     not, use LDAP or LDAPS as the protocol. UNKNOWN_HOST: The hostname of the LDAP server could not be     resolved. NO_ROUTE_TO_HOST: There is no network route to the host. BIND_EXCEPTION: A socket to the remote host could not be opened. PORT_UNREACHABLE: The LDAP port is not open on the remote host. BASE_DN_NOT_WITHIN_DOMAIN: For Active Directory, the base DN     is not a subtree of the Domain Component tree corresponding     to the LDAP domain. For example, if the domain is     \"example.com\", the baseDN should be \"dc=example, dc=com\"     or a subtree like \"ou=Users,dc=example,dc=com\". LDAP_SERVER_DISABLED: The LDAP server is marked as disabled     in the NSX configuration and will not be used.
