// Active healthchecks are disabled by default and can be enabled for a server pool by binding a health monitor to the Group through the LBRule object. This represents active health monitoring over HTTP. Active healthchecks are initiated periodically, at a configurable interval, to each member of the Group. Only if a healthcheck fails consecutively for a specified number of times (fall_count) to a member will the member status be marked DOWN. Once a member is DOWN, a specified number of consecutive successful healthchecks (rise_count) will bring the member back to UP state. After a healthcheck is initiated, if it does not complete within a certain period, then also the healthcheck is considered to be unsuccessful. Completing a healthcheck within timeout means establishing a connection (TCP or SSL), if applicable, sending the request and receiving the response, all within the configured timeout. LBHttpMonitorProfile is deprecated as NSX-T Load Balancer is deprecated.

	// There are two types of healthchecks: active and passive. Passive healthchecks depend on failures in actual client traffic (e.g. RST from server in response to a client connection) to detect that the server or the application is down. In case of active healthchecks, load balancer itself initiates new connections (or sends ICMP ping) to the servers periodically to check their health, completely independent of any data traffic. Currently, active health monitors are supported for HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, UDP and ICMP protocols.

However, in some cases this can be different because of entities have migrated thier unique identifier to NSX Policy intent objects later in the timeline and did not use unique_id for realization. Realization id is helpful for users to debug data path to correlate the configuration with corresponding intent.
