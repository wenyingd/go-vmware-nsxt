	// An application profile can be bound to a virtual server to specify the application protocol characteristics. It is used to influence how load balancing is performed. Currently, three types of application profiles are supported: LBFastTCPProfile, LBFastUDPProfile and LBHttpProfile. LBFastTCPProfile or LBFastUDPProfile is typically used when the application is using a custom protocol or a standard protocol not supported by the load balancer. It is also used in cases where the user only wants L4 load balancing mainly because L4 load balancing has much higher performance and scalability, and/or supports connection mirroring. LBHttpProfile is used for both HTTP and HTTPS applications. Though application rules, if bound to the virtual server, can be used to accomplish the same goal, LBHttpProfile is intended to simplify enabling certain common use cases. LBHttpProfile is deprecated as NSX-T Load Balancer is deprecated.

	// This is a UUID generated by the system for realizing the entity object. In most cases this should be same as 'unique_id' of the entity. However, in some cases this can be different because of entities have migrated thier unique identifier to NSX Policy intent objects later in the timeline and did not use unique_id for realization. Realization id is helpful for users to debug data path to correlate the configuration with corresponding intent.

	MarkedForDelete bool `json:"marked_for_delete,omitempty"`
	// Global intent objects cannot be modified by the user. However, certain global intent objects can be overridden locally by use of this property. In such cases, the overridden local values take precedence over the globally defined values for the properties.

	HttpRedirectTo string `json:"http_redirect_to,omitempty"`

	// It is used to specify the HTTP application idle timeout, it means that how long the load balancer will keep the connection idle to wait for the client to send the next keep-alive request. It is not a TCP socket setting.

	// NTLM is an authentication protocol that can be used over HTTP. If the flag is set to true, LB will use NTLM challenge/response methodology. This property is deprecated. Please use the property server_keep_alive in order to keep the backend server connection alive for the client connection. When create a new profile, if both ntlm and server_keep_alive are set as different values, ERROR will be reported. When update an existing profile, if either ntlm or server_keep_alive value is changed, both of them are updated with the changed value. 
	Ntlm bool `json:"ntlm,omitempty"`

	ResponseTimeout int64 `json:"response_timeout,omitempty"`
	// If server_keep_alive is true, it means the backend connection will keep alive for the client connection. Every client connection is tied 1:1 with the corresponding server-side connection. If server_keep_alive is false, it means the backend connection won't keep alive for the client connection. If server_keep_alive is not specified for API input, its value in API output will be the same with the property ntlm. 
	ServerKeepAlive bool `json:"server_keep_alive,omitempty"`
