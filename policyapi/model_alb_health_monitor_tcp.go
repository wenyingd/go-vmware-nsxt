// Advanced load balancer HealthMonitorTcp object
type AlbHealthMonitorTcp struct {
	// Match or look for this keyword in the first 2KB of server's response indicating server maintenance. A successful match results in the server being marked down. 
	MaintenanceResponse string `json:"maintenance_response,omitempty"`
	// Configure TCP health monitor to use half-open TCP connections to monitor the health of backend servers thereby avoiding consumption of a full fledged server side connection and the overhead and logs associated with it. This method is light-weight as it makes use of listener in server's kernel layer to measure the health and a child socket or user thread is not created on the server side. Allowed in Basic(Allowed values- false) edition, Essentials(Allowed values- false) edition, Enterprise edition. Default value when not specified in API or module is interpreted by ALB Controller as false. 
	TcpHalfOpen bool `json:"tcp_half_open,omitempty"`
	// Request data to send after completing the TCP handshake.
	TcpRequest string `json:"tcp_request,omitempty"`
	// Match for the desired keyword in the first 2Kb of the server's TCP response. If this field is left blank, no server response is required. 
	TcpResponse string `json:"tcp_response,omitempty"`
