// Some applications maintain state and require all relevant connections to be sent to the same server as the application state is not synchronized among servers.

	// Persistence shared setting indicates that all LBVirtualServers that consume this LBPersistenceProfile should share the same persistence mechanism when enabled.  Meaning, persistence entries of a client accessing one virtual server will also affect the same client's connections to a different virtual server. For example, say there are two virtual servers vip-ip1:80 and vip-ip1:8080 bound to the same Group g1 consisting of two servers (s11:80 and s12:80). By default, each virtual server will have its own persistence table or cookie. So, in the earlier example, there will be two tables (vip-ip1:80, p1) and (vip-ip1:8080, p1) or cookies. So, if a client connects to vip1:80 and later connects to vip1:8080, the second connection may be sent to a different server than the first.  When persistence_shared is enabled, then the second connection will always connect to the same server as the original connection. For COOKIE persistence type, the same cookie will be shared by multiple virtual servers. For SOURCE_IP persistence type, the persistence table will be shared across virtual servers. For GENERIC persistence type, the persistence table will be shared across virtual servers which consume the same persistence profile in LBRule actions. 
	PersistenceShared bool `json:"persistence_shared,omitempty"`
	// HTTP cookie domain could be configured, only available for insert mode. 
	CookieDomain string `json:"cookie_domain,omitempty"`
	// If fallback is true, once the cookie points to a server that is down (i.e. admin state DISABLED or healthcheck state is DOWN), then a new server is selected by default to handle that request. If fallback is false, it will cause the request to be rejected if cookie points to a server. 
	CookieFallback bool `json:"cookie_fallback,omitempty"`
	// If garble is set to true, cookie value (server IP and port) would be encrypted. If garble is set to false, cookie value would be plain text. 
	CookieGarble bool `json:"cookie_garble,omitempty"`
	// If cookie httponly flag is true, it prevents a script running in the browser from accessing the cookie. Only available for insert mode.
