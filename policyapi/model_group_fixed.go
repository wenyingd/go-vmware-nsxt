However, in some cases this can be different because of entities have migrated thier unique identifier to NSX Policy intent objects later in the timeline and did not use unique_id for realization. Realization id is helpful for users to debug data path to correlate the configuration with corresponding intent.

The total of IPAddressExpression, MACAddressExpression, external   IDs in an ExternalIDExpression and paths in a PathExpression must not exceed   500.   4. Each expression must be a valid Expression.

(e.g. user AD group) This field allow users to specified user context as the source of a firewall rule for IDFW feature. Current version only support a single IdentityGroupExpression. In the future, this might expand to support other conjunction and non-conjunction expression.  The extended expression list must follow below criteria: 1. Contains a single IdentityGroupExpression. No conjunction expression is supported. 2. No other non-conjunction expression is supported, except for IdentityGroupExpression. 3. Each expression must be a valid Expression. See the definition of the Expression type for more information. 4. Extended expression are implicitly AND with expression. 5. No nesting can be supported if this value is used. 6. If a Group is using extended expression, this group must be the only member in the source field of an communication map.
