ALERT - If there is a signature match on the packet, it is allowed to pass but a notification is sent to the user notifying an intrusion was detected. DROP - On a signature match, the packet is silently dropped. An alert is sent to the user that an intrusion was detected. REJECT - On a signature match, the packet is dropped and TCP RST or ICMP error messages (for non-TCP pkts) are sent to the endpoints. An alert is sent to the user that an intrusion was detected. INVALID - If the action doesn't belong to any of the above mentioned categories, it is marked as INVALID.
